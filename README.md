# What is this?

Just a quick demo how to use types with serializer when using XML input.

## Question

Someone asked help on #php channel of Symfony Slack workspace

https://symfony-devs.slack.com/archives/C6PSS2YKW/p1611605326198200

So this repository contains simple example about that.

## Usage

Just clone this repository, run composer install and start the application with
`symfony serve` command.

After that just open your browser `http://localhost:8000` and you should see `Test`
entity serialized to desired format.
